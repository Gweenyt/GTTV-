# GTTV-
GTTV was was conceived back in the late 1980's and early 1990's when video music was coming of age.  Videos from "Video Soul" and other sources were recorded on VHS without commercials.  Friends would come over to my place on Magnolia Street and get lost in the music and action.  Great times were had.  Until those precious videos are transferred to my computer of DVD, this channel will continue my work in progress.  This channel will be the new GTTV on You Tube.  Videos from my collection will be transferred here for safe keeping.  There is a vast library and lot of music to sort out.
